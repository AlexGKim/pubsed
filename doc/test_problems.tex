There is a test suit. We should describe each test problem.

\subsection{Spherical Lightbulb}

\bhead{Setup:} A spherical inner boundary emits blackbody radiation into an extremely low density
medium, with optical depth so low it is essentially vacuum.

\newcounter{tc}
\setcounter{tc}{1}
\test{tc}{Emergent Spectrum} This should be a blackbody at the input inner core temperature. Tests general sampling of 

\test{tc}{Radiation Temperature Structure}. The radiation field outside a spherical emitter should be given by the dilution factor
\begin{equation}
J = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 - \sqrt{ 1 - R_0^2/r^2} \right]
\end{equation}
