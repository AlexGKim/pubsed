You can edit the documentation files (.rst files) 

For basics of using the reStructuredTex (.rst) markup see:
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html

To compile the documentation into html or latex you must install Sphinx from
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html

e.g., on mac you can try:  
brew install sphinx-doc

Once installed, make the webpage version using

make html

The resulting webpage files appear in rhe _build/html/ directory
You can view using:

open _build/html/index.html

To make a latex file use

make latex

which makes the latex file in _build/latex/ 
You can then build a pdf using your own latex compiler
