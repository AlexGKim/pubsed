test_opacity
-------------------------------------

There are currently 3 tests of the opacity module

H_ionization:
  Calculate ionization fraction of pure iron as a 
  function of temperature

Fe_ionization:
  Calculate ionization fraction of pure iron as a 
  function of temperature
		
Expansion opacity:
  calculate expansion opacity for pure iron using both the nlte
  line data, as well as the fuzz line list.  The conditions are
  rho = 1e-13 g/cm^3,  T = 10^4 K,  time = 20 days  

Others to add... cooling curves, free-free, bound-free
nlte solves...
