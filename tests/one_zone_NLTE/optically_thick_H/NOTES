For debugging level departure coefficients from NLTE solver.

Like the optically thin version, but now see what happens when photons interact many times. We set the density to an appropriate level to ensure many interactions while maintaining a reasonable run time. For now we are initializing a blackbody and making sure it is maintained, but we might try initializing some other spectrum and making sure it transitions to a blackbody.
