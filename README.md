## Overview
Sedona is a code base primarily focused on calculating the radiation signatures of supernovae and other transient phenomena, designed to be run on a personal computer or cluster. It has functionality for hydrodynamic calculations via various solvers. Its radiation transport calculation is via an implicit Monte Carlo algorithm, which works fastest in non-diffusive regimes.  See Kasen et al. (2006), Roth & Kasen (2014) for details.
