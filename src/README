To make:

Set the environment variables GSL_DIR, LUA_DIR, and HDF5_DIR. GSL_DIR and 
HDF5_DIR should be set automatically if you're on a supercomputer and load
GSL and HDF5 modules. LUA_DIR should be set to the root lua directory. For
example, for me it's set to $SEDONA_HOME/src/external/lua-5.2.1.

Create your own make.inc file that gives the compiler (CXX) and flags
(CXXFLAGS) to use (see files for different machines for examples).

Edit Makefile so that it points to your Make.inc

Compilation will take place in the EXEC directory, producing the
executable gomc
