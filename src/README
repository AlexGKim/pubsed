To make:

Set the environment variables GSL_DIR, LUA_DIR, and HDF5_DIR. GSL_DIR and 
HDF5_DIR should be set automatically if you're on a supercomputer and load
GSL and HDF5 modules. LUA_DIR should be set to the root lua directory. For
example, for me it's set to $SEDONA_HOME/src/external/lua-5.2.1.

The rest of the instructions are on the wiki Documentation Outline

Compilation will take place in the EXEC directory, producing the
executable gomc
